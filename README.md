### 👋 Hi, I'm Sabra

 - 🌱 I'm new to data analytics and continually learning
 - 🐕‍🦺 I started this journey after my puppy broke my finger leaving me home recovering from 4 separate surgeries
 - 🔭 I’m currently working on building my portfolio to showcase my new skills
 -  ⚡ Fun fact: I actually have 2 bernedoodles, one of which is in my profile pic <- he is not the one that broke my finger
