### 👋 Hi, I'm Sabra


 - 🐾 I started my journey to data analytics in the most unlikely of places. A dog park where my very large puppy broke my finger as he jumped 
 around with the zoomies, my hand securely in his collar.
 - ⚡️ While recovering, I read multiple news articles with graphics interpreting complex data. I became intrigued with the storytelling that could be 
 accomplished with data visualization. I was hooked!
 - 👩‍💻 I spent the rest of my recovery enrolled in online programs learning the software and skills to pursue a career in data analytics.
 - 🐕‍🦺🐕‍🦺 Fun fact: I have two Berniedoodles, Romey & Coal, the one on your left is the finger culprit.
