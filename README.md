### 👋 Hi, I'm Sabra


 - ☝️ I started my journey to data analytics in the most unlikely of places. A dog park where my very large puppy broke my finger as he jumped around with the zoomies, my hand securely in his collar. While recovering, I read multiple news articles with graphics interpreting complex data. I became intrigued with the storytelling that could be accomplished using data visualization. I was hooked!
 - 🐕‍🦺🐕‍🦺 I have two Berniedoodles, Romey & Coal, the one on your left was the finger culprit
